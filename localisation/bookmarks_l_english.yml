 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Gathering Storm"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. In France stability has finally been achieved, but at the cost of civil liberties. The old generals of the Great War draw their attention to colonies and land taken from them. In Hungary and Italy the Fourth International look to the plight of the workers of their neighbours, while all across the globe the dominions of Great Britain, still undefeated, desire their independence more than ever. A single spark may be all it takes."

 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Although the British Empire emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of her finest were lost in trenches all around the globe, while unrest spread in her colonies as financial crisis followed.\n\nWith the last war still in mind, and the dominions still grumbling, The British Empire stand at yet another crossroads. Maintain supremacy, no matter the cost, or let over 500 years of dominance crumble into dust?"
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Great War made none suffer as much as the French, as colonial and national territories were lost to rivals and war was waged on their soil from the very start to the very end. Countless died, and the last decade was plagued with civil war and turmoil.\n\nFrom the ashes rose a new France, a France driven by dreams of revanchism with a people unified under a single, strong leader. Strike too early, and the great power will snuff out the dream, strike too late and there might never be a chance at all."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Great War put an end to German Imperialism and gave birth to the Weimar Republic. Despite civil turmoil and economic unrest, the once incredibly hated republic has managed to recover and Germany has become a center of culture, science and liberty.\n\nEnemies will look to her landshowever, as hostile, non-democratic states rise on all her borders, threatening her integrity yet again. On the inside, there are still elements who would like to topple the regime. Can the Wiemar Republic stand the test of time?"
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Despite being on the winning side of The Great War, Italy gained little but a few French colonies in North Africa. The Balkan promises were forgotten by the British. Combined with the massive cost of lives and a crippled economy, a revolution known as Biennio Rosso saw the King and government overthrown by radicals.\n\nInspired by Béla Kun's Hungary, a socialist republic was formed. During skirmishes with the Balkan states, Italy has prepared a land connection to their Hungarian ally, with an ever-shrinking Croatia squeezed in between them."
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Empire of Japan stands at a crossroads. Hokushin-ron, the Northern Expansion Doctrine, is favored by the Army and calls for an advance into Free Russia. Nanshin-ron, the Southern Expansion Doctrine, is supported by the Navy and has the rich European colonies in Southeast Asia and the Pacific as its target. \n\nAnd then, of course, there is always China. Japan possesses a formidable military, but its industries are starving for resources and time is running out. Which path to choose?"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As an armistice was signed by the Whites, Lenin and his Soviet Union could finally focus on industrialising and building up their economy. Still, the generals of the Red Army, with Trotsky at the helm, warns that a peace with the Whites will not last, and that a continuation war is to be expected.\n\nMeanwhile, there is inner political turmoil, as an aging Lenin is expected to pass soon, and many powerful factions struggle for the seat of power. Enemies could make use of this turmoil, be they Whites or someone else..."
 SPR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Spain has been held together by the cross, the monarch and the investment of foreign nations. A stagnating economy, underrepresented lower classes, and fierce local nationalism strains the once mighty Empire to no end. Now their once most vital allies, the British, have withdrawn their money and military support and Spain is trembling.\n\nThere is still hope however. Ever since the Pope fled from Italy and was granted residence in Santiago de Compostela, there has been a fervant desire to reinstall the Pontiff in Rome."

 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "After centuries in which the Polish nation has been divided between three empires, Poland now stands independent once again. But its position is not an easy one. \n\nIn the east, the Soviet Union has not forgotten the humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war. \n\nIn the south, more socialists press against Polish borders and while Germany may seem stable and democratic now, there are still those who desire Polish lands."
 SCA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United Kingdoms, or Scandinavia, was formed when Sweden incorporated Norway at the end of the Napoleonic wars. Despite staying neutral during The Great War, Scandinavia suffers from turmoil.\n\nThe Military does not trust the Soviet Union to respect their Finish borders, and rising nationalist groups in Finland and Norway struggle for independence. For Scandinavia is run mostly from Sweden, and things will have to change if a Scandinavian ruler wants to avoid bloody revolution."
 UNI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United Provinces. Temporary text."
 RUS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Great War took its toll on Russia, and when the people had enough the Tsar was ousted. The democratic republic of Russia did not last however, and soon a civil war erupted in between the Whites and The Reds. The war lasted with varying intensity for over ten years, until both sides realised the futile hope of achieving total victory.\n\nNow Russia resides far to the east, with their royal family long since executed by the reds. The nation is politically unstable, and is threatened by the Soviets to the West, and an ever aggressive Japan to the east."
 ROL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Republic of Louisiana declared independence from Napoleonic France in 1800, shortly after being ceded from Spain to France. Under the leadership of Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours Louisiana managed to stay clear of war, promising Britain neutrality in the Napoleon wars.\n\nThe Republic was the first to offer the public vote, and saw a huge immigration in promise of land and low taxation. A few wars have been fought with in particular Mexico, as Mexican expense, but they remained neutral during the Great War. These days, racial tensions and economic depression are her greatest threats."
 BNA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The crown jewel of the British Empire, British North America is a strange combination of imperial power and imperial powerlessness. A tiny elite of British civil servants rule over a vast subcontinent filled with hundreds of millions of subjects. From their ranks recruits the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndian leaders hoped that the sacrifices made in the last war would help India gain her independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been disappointed. With a new war looming, many believe that the time has come to take that freedom - by whatever means necessary."
 MEX_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Mexico, a democratic republic with a large pool of European immigrants."
 HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Hungary - Bela Kun succeeded. What do you know?"
 ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Romania and stuff."
 SER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Serbia still hoists their flag up high."
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Raj - Crown Jewel number 2."
 ARG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Argentina, pretty fascist right now."
 BRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Brasil, still in the working."
